Planets now spawn. I added some very basic properties to planets as well so you can start working
On those UI scenes.

Planets now are in a NodeGroup named `PLANET_SCENE`

You can call get_tree().get_nodes_in_group( "PLANET_SCENE" ) ("I think?" ), and it will return an array of planet scenes.

Don't worry about making Icons for now. That will require some special code, and we will most likely we will need to hoist the planet into a resource
or duplicate the planet and then construct them.
